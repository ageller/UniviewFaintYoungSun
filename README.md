# UniviewFaintYoungSun
Uniview module to show the evolving Sun, with interior cutaway, based on a MESA model

Also contains an Earth, with atmosphere getting redder with increasing CO2 levels (red when Sun was young)

Also contains a Venus, with a potential early ocean, drying up with time.

I should probably split these into separate modules!
